# Java-Programming-Arrays-Lists-and-Structured-Data
My solutions to coding problems in Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data at Coursera.org offered by Duke University

This course is offered at <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> and is part of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming">Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals</a>.

This is the third course of the Specialization, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-programming-arrays-lists-data">Link to the course</a>.

Some code should be run in a custom Bluej Development Environment made by Duke's University especially for this course. You can get the IDE from the University website <a href="http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/downloads/bluej.php?course=2">here</a>.

Here's my <a>certificate</a> on completing the course.
